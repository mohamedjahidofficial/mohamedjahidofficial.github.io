As a self-care treatment, it's traditionally done in the morning, before bathing, and is especially useful as a daily ritual in the winter months, says Graciella Zogbi, a Vedic health educator at the Raj Maharishi Ayurveda Health Spa in Iowa. "Vata by its nature is dry and cold. With abhyanga, the warm oil penetrates the skin. Its lubricating quality is the complete opposite of vata, and it's balancing on that level."</span></span></span></span></p>

Fresh leaves of anti Vata plants, such as Eranda (Ricinus communis), Arka (Calotropis Procera), Nirgundi (Vitex negundo), Rasna (Pluchea lanceolata), Coconut leaves, lemon and curcumin are fried with herbal ingredients and tied into cloth boluses. These are dipped into warm medicated oil and used for massaging the body. The treatment begins with the application of suitable medicated oil to the entire body. The massage with heated boluses induces profuse sudation, which helps in the fomentation process.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Therapist prepares dough from special grains which is shaped into a small ring and placed on the affected area. This adheres to the skin and is then filled with heated, medicated oil. The oil is retained within the ring at a specific temperature for a specific time. This helps the oil to penetrate deeper into the tissues, softening the stiff and tight muscles. Once the oil is removed the therapist will massage specific marma points around the affected area to repair ligaments and tendons, followed by a localised herbal steam to deepen the effect.</span></span></span></span></p>

The herbs are selected on the basis of the ailment being treated. The herbal powders are first placed in a sterile bowl and fried in different herbal oils depending on the kind of treatment, and then tied into the bolus. Several of these boluses are formed.

In the next step, a pan with oil is heated on the stove on low heat. The bolus is heated or dipped in hot oil, and then rubbed on the affected part of the body to begin the treatment process. It is also applied without oil if dry heat is necessary.

When the temperature of the bolus starts to drop, a new bolus is used to continue with the treatment. The key is to ensure that the bolus is hot enough throughout the process. Fomentation takes effect when the patient begins to feel sweaty and light.

The treatment helps in reducing tenderness, heaviness, stiffness, pain, or inflammation of the joints or other body parts. This is accomplished by improving blood circulation, releasing trapped nerves, enhancing joint movements, and reducing swelling.</span></span></span></span></p>

It is an ancient Ayurvedic healing practice which has been performed in India for about the last 5000 years. This treatment has immense impact on the nervous system. It immediately acts to calm and relax your mind and has a cleansing effect on the nerves.

Shirodhara is extremely beneficial for people suffering from imbalance of Vata and Pitta. A person suffers from feelings of fear, insecurity and worry when his/her Vata is out of balance. Imbalance of Pitta can cause a person to become angry, frustrated, irritated and even cause him to lose the sense of right and wrong. Shirodhara involves the use of such liquids that help to counter the negative effects of the out-of-balance doshas or conditions. The liquid soothes and pacifies the doshas when applied to the forehead, scalp and nervous system.</span></span></span></span></p>
